H5MD : HDF5 for molecular data
==============================

H5MD is a file format specification, based upon `HDF5
<http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_, aimed at the efficient and portable storage
of molecular data (e.g. simulation trajectories, molecular structures, ...).

The first official release of the specification will contain particle
trajectories (positions, velocities, forces and species) as well as
thermodynamical observables. Afterwards, extensions will be considered on the
basis of discussion with users of H5MD.

H5MD is developed by Pierre de Buyl, Peter Colberg and Felix Höfling and is
available under the `GNU General Public License
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_.

The draft represents the current state of the specification.
